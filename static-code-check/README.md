# Static & Lint Check #

## Goal ##
Eventually we want to have a uniform coding style so that you don't have to hear too many **wtf**s when you are on holidays because someone else edits your code.


## Code Check Tools ##
There are many available tools to check the code styling, convention and lint

1. [Ruboto Style Check](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop): check general Ruby code style
2. [Rails Best Practices](https://github.com/railsbp/rails_best_practices): check conventional Rails styling

## Useful Tips ##
### Sublime Space vs Tab ###

If you are using sublime, probably you are using tab by default. See below image:

![Tab vs Space](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/358323/screenshots/work/server-recommendation-gems/tab-vs-space.png)

You can switch between tab and space, but you may want to default tab to space. Go to `Preferences` > `Settings - User` and use below settings:

```javascript
{
	"show_full_path": true,
	"translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
}
```

If you want to have a specific setting on file type (e.g. say Ruby), you can open a Ruby file and go to `Preferences` > `Settings - More` > `Syntax Specific - User`

```javascript
{
	"extensions":
	[
		"rb",
		"Vagrantfile",
		"Guardfile",
		"Berksfile"
	], // up to you for this extension formats
	"tab_size": 2,
	"translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
}
```

### Sublime plugin for Rubocop ###

You can install plugin of Rubocop so that it can highlight in real-time. First, you need to install [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation). Once installed, you can look for package manager by `shift + command + p` > look for `Package Control: Install Package` > type `Rubocop`

#### Key Binding ####

Once you install sublime plugin for Rubocop, it will automatically check text view and mark it the warnings. If you don't want it to mark, you can disable it by `Preferences` > `Package Settings` > `RuboCop` > `Settings - User`. From you can decide if you want to enable/disable this feature by default.

```javascript
{
	"mark_issues_in_view": false // disable by default
}
```

You can also use key binding to toggle this setting on the fly. `Preferences` > `Package Settings` > `RuboCop` > `Key Bindings - User`.

```javascript
[
	// you can set any keys you want. In this case, I use Command + Option + Shift + r
    { "keys": ["super+alt+shift+r"], "command": "rubocop_pause_toggle" }
]
```


### Atom ###
You can use [Atom](https://atom.io/) edit if you want. Rubocop also has plugin for this. 

#### Plugin Installation ####

Go go `Atom` > `Preference` > `Packages` > search for `Atom Lint` > install `Policeman Rubocop`.

#### Usage ####

Default key binding to toggle Rubocop is `Control` + `Option` + `L`.

## Rubocop Check ##

Sometimes it's probably very hard to eliminate all warnings generated by Rubocop even after ignoring some files and folders. I guess I would accept any number of warnings less than twice of the number of files checked. i.e. if you are checking 56 files, then expectation is that the number of warnings should be less than 112.
